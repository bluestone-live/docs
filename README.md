# BlueStone Documentation

This is the documentation website for BlueStone generated by [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and deployed by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Contribution

To add/edit content, the simpliest way is to use the editor provided by GitHub. Notice that if we want to change the navigation items on the left panel, we need to update `src/SUMMARY.md`.

Alternatively, please install [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and then serve the website in local:

```
mdbook serve
```

Once a commit is pushed to master branch, the site will be automatically rebuilt by Travis CI.
