# Learn More

We have so far covered all core functionalities the protocol provides, but they do not yet comprise the comprehensive list of functions we can interact with the contract. If you would like to learn more about other contract functions, please take a look at the protocol interface [IProtocol.sol](https://github.com/bluestone-live/bluestone/blob/master/contracts/protocol/interface/IProtocol.sol).

If you have any questions, feel free to let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/bluestone-live/docs/issues/new).
