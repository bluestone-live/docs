# Distributor Guides

To incentivize the adoption of BlueStone, we are giving away a share of interest generated by the protocol to distributors who integrate [Deposit](../developer-guides/deposit.md) or [Loan](../developer-guides/loan.md) service into their own application/platform.

As a distributor, interest will pay out immediately to `distributorAddress` you specified in the function call whenever there is a matured deposit withdrawn, a loan get fully repaid, or a loan get liquidated.

## Distributor Fee Ratios

How much interest a distributor can earn is determined by `depositDistributorFeeRatio` and `loanDistributorFeeRatio` set in the contract. Each ratio represents the percentage of interest a distributor receives as reward.

Notice that these ratios may subject to change, we can read their values (scaled by `1e18`) by calling the following function:

```javascript
const {
  depositDistributorFeeRatio,
  loanDistributorFeeRatio
} = await protocol.methods
  .getMaxDistributorFeeRatios
  .call()
```
